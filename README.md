These betting strategies exploit mispriced odds by and between bookmakers on various sports games.

Arbitrage Betting: (risk-free)
A completely risk-free, profit-guaranteed method of sports betting.

For each event, there is something called the 'implied probability'. This is calculated by summing the reciprocal of each of the odds values.
Take, for example, an imaginary tennis game between Djokovic and Sinner. sportsbet puts both their odds of winning at 1.9.
The implied probability here is 1/1.9 + 1/1.9 = 1.0526...
Bookmakers' odds are designed to have an implied probability > 1, which is known as the 'house edge'. 

However, if we compare various bookmakers' odds, there is a chance of a 'mispricing', meaning that some bookies may price differently to others, 
resulting in differing odds for the same game.
For example, in the tennis match from earlier, sportsbet has Djovokovics' odds of winning at 1.9, but another bookie ladbrokes may put Sinner's odds at 2.2.
Here, the implied probability is 1/1.9 + 1/2.2 = 0.98086...

So this is considered an 'arbitrage opportunity'; if the implied probability is < 1.
What we can do is bet on both events (Djokovic winning on sportsbet, and Sinner winning on ladbrokes) to guarantee ourselves profit regardless of the outcome.

Pros: guaranteed profit, no risk
Cons: harder to find arb opportunities, less profit per game

Positive EV: (risk-aware)
A mathematically profitable, long-term sports betting strategy based on finding mispriced odds.

Every betting market has a true probability of an outcome occurring. While bookmakers often skew their odds to build in a profit margin (like in arbitrage), 
these true probabilities can often be estimated using betting exchanges, which are peer-to-peer platforms where odds reflect actual supply and demand, not house edge.

For example, if a betting exchange has a tennis player listed at 2.00 (decimal odds), this implies a true probability of 1/2.00 = 50%.
Now, let’s say a bookmaker lists odds of 2.20 for the same player. This means the bookmaker is implying a probability of 1/2.20 = 45.45%.

Here’s where Positive EV comes in:
If the true probability is 50%, but the bookie is offering odds that imply only 45.45%, then you’re getting more value than you should — a “+EV” or “positive expected value” bet. 
Over time, consistently placing bets where the true probability > implied probability leads to profit in the long run, even if individual bets may lose.

You can calculate EV using this formula:
EV = (True Probability × Profit) - ((1 - True Probability) × Bet Size)
If EV > 0, the bet has positive expected value.

Pros: long-term greater profit, easier to find opportunities
Cons: more risk, exchange probabilities aren't 100% reliable
